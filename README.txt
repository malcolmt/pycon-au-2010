The two Django projects here were used to illustrate data importing techniques
in my talk "Displaying Australian datasets with Django" at PyCon-AU, 27 June,
2010.

Each project contains its own README.txt file explaining how to download the
relevant dataset. Aside from the dataset and database, all the other software
pieces are included in this package to enabled you to display the data in
Django's admin interface.
